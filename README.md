# Shock package
A Matlab package containing different shock classes based on the shock models used in the MSc thesis by Andréas Sundström. However as of now, the normalization is not the same as was used in the thesis; to get to the normalization of the thesis use
   psi   = phi / tau
   x_new = x_old / sqrt(tau)
The rest of the values should be the same.

The code will be cleaned up, and examples provided by the end of May.
